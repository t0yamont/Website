While the EV vehicle is being designed, we hope to train and pass knowledge down to our brand new members by using the combustion car that will be built during the 2023/24 academic year and future years. Further down you can see our previous combustion car that built the foundations of TEAM SURTES.​",-1),k=e("h2",{class:"flex flex-col items-center py-6"},"STAG '09",-1),E={class:"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-4 md:gap-8 py-4 items-center"},T=e("p",{class:"lg:col-span-2 xl:col-span-3"},"In the academic year of 2008/9, a dedicated group of students from Mechanical, Medical and Aerospace engineering designed and manufactured Surrey's first Formula Student racing car to compete in the Formula Student competition.

The car proved highly competitive and was the 3rd fastest UK car in the acceleration event.
